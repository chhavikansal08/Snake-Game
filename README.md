## Introduction

This Snake Game is implemented in C++ and demonstrates the classic snake-eating-food gameplay. The snake grows longer as it consumes food, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself.

- **S or Down Arrow:** Move the snake downwards.
- **D or Right Arrow:** Move the snake rightwards.
